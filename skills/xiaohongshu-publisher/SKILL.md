# Xiaohongshu Publisher - 小红书发布助手

## Overview

This skill enables automated posting to Xiaohongshu (小红书) using browser automation. It takes a title, body text, and optional image paths, then navigates the Xiaohongshu creator platform to create and publish a图文笔记.

## When to Use

- User says "发小红书" followed by content
- User says "小红书发布助手" with content
- User asks to publish a图文教程 to Xiaohongshu
- User wants to automate repetitive posting tasks

## Prerequisites

1. **Browser profile**: Use OpenClaw's browser with profile="openclaw"
2. **Login status**: User must be logged into Xiaohongshu in that browser profile. The skill will check for login and guide if not.
3. **Creator platform access**: The Xiaohongshu account must have access to the creator platform (usually automatic).

## Input Format

The skill expects structured input. When the user provides content naturally, extract these fields:

- **Title** (required): The post headline
- **Body** (required): Main content text (supports markdown, emojis)
- **Image paths** (optional): Array of local file paths or URLs to images

### Example User Messages

> "发小红书：标题『OpenClaw部署教程』正文：这是一篇保姆级教程... 图片：C:\\pics\\cover.png"

> "小红书发布助手，帮我发这个图文：标题『AI工具推荐』内容：今天推荐几个好用的... 配图就放桌面上那几张"

If the user doesn't specify images, the skill will prompt for them or proceed with text-only post (if platform allows).

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Launch Browser and Verify Login

1. Use `browser` tool with `action="open"`, `profile="openclaw"`, `url="https://creator.xiaohongshu.com"` to open creator platform
2. Check if login is required by taking a snapshot and looking for login prompts
3. If not logged in, instruct user to log in manually and then continue

### Step 2: Navigate to Upload Interface

1. On creator platform, click the "上传图文" button (upload图文)
   - Use snapshot to find the correct element (ref often `e107` or similar)
2. Wait for the upload form to load

### Step 3: Fill Content

**Title:** Find the title input field (usually near the top) and type the title using `act` with kind="type"

**Body:** Find the main text area and type the body content. For longer content, consider pasting with `paste` action.

**Images (if provided):**

1. Find the upload area (usually a "Choose File" button or drag-drop zone)
2. For local images, use the file upload dialog: 
   - Use `act` with kind="click" on the upload button
   - Use `act` with kind="type" on the file input to set the file path (may need to handle multiple files)
   - Or use `upload` action if available
3. For remote images, download them first then upload

### Step 4: Publish

1. Find the publish button (usually labeled "发布" or "发布笔记")
2. Click it using `act` with kind="click"
3. Wait for confirmation (success message or redirect)
4. Inform user that the post was published successfully, include the post URL if available

## Scripts

### `scripts/publish_xiaohongshu.py`

A Python script that handles the browser automation steps above. It uses Playwright to control the browser directly, which can be more reliable than step-by-step `act` calls.

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/publish_xiaohongshu.py --title "标题" --body "内容" --images image1.jpg image2.jpg
```

**Features:**
- Waits for elements to load
- Handles file uploads
- Returns the final post URL
- Error handling for common issues (login required, upload failed)

If this script is present, prefer using it via `exec` with pty=true for reliability.

## References

### `references/page_structure.md`

Contains the current DOM structure of the Xiaohongshu creator platform, updated periodically. Includes selectors for key elements:
- Upload图文 button
- Title input field
- Body textarea
- Image upload area
- Publish button
- Success indicators

Use this reference when the script fails or when selectors need updating.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Text Post

**User:** "发小红书：标题『测试』正文：这是一条测试内容"

**Skill execution:**
1. Open creator platform
2. Click "上传图文"
3. Type title "测试"
4. Type body "这是一条测试内容"
5. Click publish
6. Confirm success

### Example 2: Post with Images

**User:** "小红书发布助手，标题『我的猫』正文：看看我家主子 图片：C:\\photos\\cat1.jpg, C:\\photos\\cat2.jpg"

**Skill execution:**
1. Same as above, but after filling text, upload both images
2. Wait for uploads to complete
3. Publish

### Example 3: Handle Missing Login

**User:** "发小红书：标题『测试』正文：测试"

**If not logged in:**
1. Detect login required
2. Respond: "请先在小红书创作平台手动登录，然后告诉我继续"
3. User logs in, says "继续"
4. Resume from Step 2

## Error Handling

| Error | Detection | Handling |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Not logged in | Snapshot shows login button/prompt | Ask user to log in manually, then resume |
| Upload failed | Script timeout or error | Retry up to 3 times, then inform user |
| Element not found | Snapshot missing expected refs | Refresh page, if still missing, ask user to navigate manually |
| Publish button disabled | Snapshot shows button disabled | Check for missing required fields (title/body/images) and prompt user |

## Notes

- This skill relies on the stability of Xiaohongshu's web interface. If the site updates, the skill may need maintenance.
- Always prefer using the Python script for reliability; fall back to step-by-step browser actions if script fails.
- Respect platform posting limits; avoid too-frequent posts.
- Never store user passwords; rely on manual login and session persistence.
